     <h1>How it works</h1>
    </div>
        <div class="p1">
        <p>Indie gaming refers to the creation and distribution of video games by independent developers, without the involvement of major game publishers or studios. Here's a general overview of how indie gaming typically works: Idea generation: Indie game developers usually come up with their own ideas for the game they want to create. They may be inspired by their personal interests, experiences, or passions. </p>
        </div>

     <div class="h2">
     <h2>Development:</h2>
     </div>
        <div class="p2">
        <p>Once they have an idea, indie game developers typically start the development process on their own or with a small team. They may use game development engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine to create their games. </p>
        </div>
    
     <div class="h3">
     <h2>Funding:</h2>
    </div>
        <div class="p3">
        <p>Indie game developers often have to rely on their own savings or seek out alternative sources of funding, such as crowdfunding or grants, to finance their games. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="h4">
    <h2>Publishing:</h2>
    </div>
        <div class="p4">
        <p>Once the game is complete, indie game developers have several options for publishing and distributing their game. They may self-publish on digital platforms such as Steam, GOG, or itch.io. Alternatively, they may seek out a publishing partner to help market and distribute their game. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="h5">
    <h2>Marketing and promotion:</h2>
    </div>
        <div class="p5">
        <p>Indie game developers often have to do their own marketing and promotion to get their game noticed. They may use social media, press releases, and game shows to build buzz around their game. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="h6">
    <h2>Sales:</h2>
    </div>
        <div class="p6">
        <p>Once the game is published and available for sale, indie game developers earn revenue through sales on digital platforms or through their own website. They may also offer paid DLC (Downloadable Content) or in-game purchases to generate additional revenue. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="p7">
        <p>Indie gaming can be a challenging and rewarding field for developers, as it allows for more creative freedom and the opportunity to connect with passionate communities of players. However, it also requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and entrepreneurial spirit to succeed. </p>
