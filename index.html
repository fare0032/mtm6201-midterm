    <p>Indie gaming refers to video games developed and published by independent developers or small teams without the backing of major publishers or studios. Indie games are typically created with a limited budget and resources, but they often offer unique and innovative gameplay experiences that can't be found in big-budget titles. The indie gaming scene has grown rapidly in recent years, thanks in part to the rise of digital distribution platforms like Steam, Itch.io, and the App Store. These platforms have made it easier for independent developers to reach a wider audience and compete with larger studios.</p>
